<h2>
  Summary
</h2>
<p>
  My chosen artifact was the final project from CS320 known as the Contact Service Application
  originally written in Java. The original program was created a little less than a year ago. 
  I chose this item for my ePortfolio because I believed it would make a good candidate for using a
  single artifact to meet all three areas of enhancement.

<h2>
  Milestone Two Software Design Enhancement
</h2>
<p>
  In this specific milestone I showcase my abilities in software development by using my acquired skills to build a full stack web application. 
  This required me to build an application from scratch and utilize various languages to design it, 
  such as html, javascript, and typescript. I believe I have met my chosen course outcome for this enhancement, demonstrating my ability to use 
  well founded and innovative techniques in computer practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions. 
  By utilizing Express, Angular, and Node.js I have managed to use more recent innovative techniques to build my application.

<h2>
  Milestone Three Data Structures and Algorithms Enhancement
</h2>
<p>
  In this milestone, I showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures by not only using multiple different 
  types of data structures to create my full stack application but I have also employed the use of the built in MatTable sorting 
  algorithm to sort the various contact, appointment, and task data according to the user’s needs. In this enhancement the course 
  outcome I strove to achieve was ‘Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles 
  and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices 
  (data structures and algorithms)’. While I still have work to do to ensure this algorithm is applied to each table properly, 
  I believe I am on track to meet all the course outcomes by the end of all planned enhancements.  While working on this enhancement I 
  faced quite a few challenges. These included developing a sorting algorithm, sorting control based on header clicks, and how to populate 
  data to the given table.

<h2>
  Milestone Four Database Enhancement
</h2>
<p>
  In this milestone, I showcase my skills and abilities in databases by creating a database in MongoDB and connecting it to my web application. 
  For this enhancement I originally planned on meeting the course outcomes ‘Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in 
  software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data 
  and resources’ and ‘Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose 
  of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)’ . As I have 
  successfully created a and connected to a secure database I believe I have met this outcome. I believe I could go above and beyond 
  with this requirement by incorporating a user authorization service to ensure only authorized access to the database is allowed. However, this 
  feature would need to be incorporated on the final deliverable.
