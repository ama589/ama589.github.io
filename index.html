<h2>
  Professional Self-Assessment
</h2>
<p>
  Deciding to pursue a career in computer science was no easy decision. As I had already established a career in 
  accounting it was a drastic change that required a serious change in mindset. However as I have reached the point 
  where I am able to create a web application featured below, it is clear just how far I have come since the start of 
  my courses. While I have chosen to showcase the three major areas of enhancements on a single artifact this is just 
  a bit of the skills I have developed. Throughout my courses I have had to complete a variety of projects that ranged 
  from simulating a SCRUM team, developing a mobile Android application, generating technical reports for potential stakeholders,
  learning how to leverage the various AWS services, and developing a functional AI treasure hunt game. With these wide variety
  of skills I hope to acquire a position in either the software development, web development, or mobile app development. 
  While I am sure I still have much to learn, I will continue to try and develop my skills and acquire new ones on my career journey. 

  For this portfolio I have created a functional MEAN web application, CATScheduling, to showcase my skills in software engineering 
  and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The original artifact that this application is based on was a basic 
  Java program that allowed users to create tasks, appointments, and contacts. However as this application only ran in a command 
  window, it served no value to outside parties. Due to this factor and the fact that I believed it would meet all the enhancement 
  categories I chose to use this program as my chosen artifact. With the enhancements made, this web application allows users to create 
  and manage contacts, appointments, and tasks. Below you will find the various stages in my development and the milestones at which I
  incorporated the skills mentioned above. The final polished application can be found at the bottom. This polished version will incorporate
  feedback I had received throughout the term and the additional skills and knowledge I learned while in the development phase.

<h2>
  Enhancement One Software Design Enhancement
</h2>
<p>
  In this specific milestone I showcase my abilities in software development by using my acquired skills to build a full stack web application. 
  This required me to build an application from scratch and utilize various languages to design it, 
  such as html, javascript, and typescript. I believe I have met my chosen course outcome for this enhancement, demonstrating my ability to use 
  well founded and innovative techniques in computer practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions. 
  By utilizing Express, Angular, and Node.js I have managed to use more recent innovative techniques to build my application.
  Although I still have the remainder of the course outcomes to meet with the later enhancements I believe this is sufficient for the one described above.
  While working on this enhancement I face a number of challenges. These included how to first construct the web application, securing a connection to the 
  server, and developing the necessary components needed. Coupled with later enhancements I eventually had to recreate the web application to avoid a very
  convoluted file structure and code. This change can be seen in the final polished application.

<h2>
  Enhancement Two Data Structures and Algorithms Enhancement
</h2>
<p>
  In this milestone, I showcase my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures by not only using multiple different 
  types of data structures to create my full stack application but I have also employed the use of the built in MatTable sorting 
  algorithm to sort the various contact, appointment, and task data according to the user’s needs. In this enhancement the course 
  outcome I strove to achieve was ‘Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles 
  and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices 
  (data structures and algorithms)’. While I still have work to do to ensure this algorithm is applied to each table properly, 
  I believe I am on track to meet all the course outcomes by the end of all planned enhancements.  While working on this enhancement I 
  faced quite a few challenges. These included developing a sorting algorithm, sorting control based on header clicks, and how to populate 
  data to the given table.

<h2>
  Enhancement Three Database Enhancement
</h2>
<p>
  In this milestone, I showcase my skills and abilities in databases by creating a database in MongoDB and connecting it to my web application. 
  For this enhancement I originally planned on meeting the course outcomes ‘Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in 
  software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data 
  and resources’ and ‘Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose 
  of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)’ . As I have 
  successfully created a and connected to a secure database I believe I have met this outcome. I believe I could go above and beyond 
  with this requirement by incorporating a user authorization service to ensure only authorized access to the database is allowed. However, this 
  feature would need to be incorporated on the final deliverable.
